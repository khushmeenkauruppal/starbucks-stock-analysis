Monthly and Yearly Volumes smooth out daily fluctuations, revealing long-term trading behavior and trends.\n",
    "3. Yearly Average Close: It gives a clearer picture of the stock's annual performance, helping investors compare year-over-year (YoY) trends and identify periods of growth or stagnation.\n",
    "4. Daily Returns Histogram: Plotting the distribution of daily returns provides an overview of the stock's volatility and potential risk levels. Understanding the distribution of returns can aid in risk management and portfolio optimization.\n",
    "5. Simple Moving Average: The SMA chart helps in identifying trends and smoothing out short-term fluctuations, providing a clearer picture of the stock's overall direction.\n",
    "6. Volatility Over the Years: The volatility graph categorizes periods into high, moderate, or low volatility. High volatility indicates periods of uncertainty or significant market events. Low volatility suggests stable market conditions. Moderate volatility is a transitional state."
